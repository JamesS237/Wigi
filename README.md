Wigi

What is this?
-------------
This is Wigi. My Git-backed Wiki. I was desperate for some spare rails projects to try, and my mind was going back to previous wiki ideas, and I thought about how I'd do a history, then I realized, hey, I can do that with Git! And thus, the horrible idea was born.

Why?
----
Because stupid projects are fun

Please for the love of all that is good never actually use this, this is a fun but stupid project.

Current State

Right now you can load pages. That's about it.
